# FRONTEND APP LAYOUT CLUSTER KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`components/layout/app-layout/` is the dense shell-state cluster behind `../AppLayout.tsx`. It owns sidebar and header composition, profile switcher behavior, profile dialog state, shell-only route scoping, profile mismatch messaging, and the visible version label.

## STRUCTURE
```
app-layout/
├── AppHeader.tsx                 # Shell header, profile switcher trigger, shell controls
├── AppSidebar.tsx                # Sidebar navigation and collapse behavior
├── ProfileDialogs.tsx            # Create, edit, activate, and delete profile dialogs
├── ProfileSwitcherPopover.tsx    # Profile switcher list, search, and actions
├── useAppLayoutState.ts          # Shell composition over auth, profile, dialogs, and sidebar state
├── useProfileDialogState.ts      # Profile dialog open state and mutation handlers
├── useProfileSwitcherState.ts    # Switcher filtering, focus, and selection behavior
├── profileConflictMessageParser.ts # Profile-limit and conflict messaging helpers
└── navigationProfileConfig.ts    # Nav links, profile-scoped prefixes, profile cap, version label
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Shell composition and `Outlet` handoff: `../AppLayout.tsx`
- Sidebar links, profile-scoped route prefixes, max profile count, and visible version label: `navigationProfileConfig.ts`
- Auth/profile context composition, sidebar state, route-scope detection, and logout flow: `useAppLayoutState.ts`
- Dialog open state and profile CRUD/activate/delete handlers: `useProfileDialogState.ts`, `ProfileDialogs.tsx`
- Switcher filtering, focus management, and selected-profile handoff: `useProfileSwitcherState.ts`, `ProfileSwitcherPopover.tsx`
- Conflict copy parsing for profile-limit and duplicate-name flows: `profileConflictMessageParser.ts`

## CONVENTIONS

- Keep `AppLayout.tsx` thin. State composition belongs in `useAppLayoutState.ts`.
- Keep navigation, profile-scoped prefixes, profile cap, and version-label formatting in `navigationProfileConfig.ts`.
- Use `useAuth()` and `useProfileContext()` through `useAppLayoutState.ts`; route shells should not duplicate shell bootstrap logic.
- Keep dialog mutation handlers in `useProfileDialogState.ts`, with `ProfileDialogs.tsx` staying presentation-focused.
- Keep profile switcher filtering and focus behavior in `useProfileSwitcherState.ts` instead of scattering it across header or popover components.
- When doing upgrade work, backward compatibility with the pre-upgrade implementation is not a goal unless explicitly requested. Do not add compatibility shims, dual paths, or fallback behavior solely to preserve the old interface.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not move route-specific query or data-fetch logic into the shell cluster.
- Do not duplicate nav-link definitions, profile-scoped prefixes, or version-label logic outside `navigationProfileConfig.ts`.
- Do not bypass the dialog or switcher hooks with ad hoc local state in `AppHeader.tsx` or `AppSidebar.tsx`.
- Do not blur selected-profile shell state with active runtime profile semantics.
