# FRONTEND LIB KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`src/lib/` is the frontend boundary to backend contracts and browser integrations. Keep the shared hotspots here: `api/core.ts`, `websocket.ts`, `referenceData.ts`, `configImportValidation.ts`, `loadbalanceRoutingPolicy.ts`, `appVersion.ts`, `timezone.ts`, `costing.ts`, `clipboard.ts`, and `webauthn.ts`. `websocket/AGENTS.md` owns the helper split beneath the singleton client, and stats callers should go through the typed observability clients for the unified usage-snapshot route and the retained shared stats routes.

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Public import boundary: `api.ts`
- Typed `/api/*` client split, grouped surfaces, and `api/core.ts` request rules: `api/AGENTS.md`
- Shared vendor cache, request dedupe, and dataset registry: `referenceData.ts`, `referenceDataRegistry.ts`
- Frontend-side config import reference validation: `configImportValidation.ts`, `configImportValidationReferences.ts`
- Shared adaptive routing-policy defaults and failure-status normalization: `loadbalanceRoutingPolicy.ts`
- Browser app version label formatting and Vite-injected package metadata: `appVersion.ts`
- WebSocket connection state, reconnects, channel ref-counts, protocol parsing, and profile switching: `websocket.ts`, `websocket/AGENTS.md`
- Shared timezone preference lookup and formatting helpers consumed by `useTimezone()`: `timezone.ts`
- Shared cost, currency, and usage-label helpers: `costing.ts`
- Browser clipboard helpers reused across route shells and detail views: `clipboard.ts`
- Browser passkey helpers and support checks: `webauthn.ts`
- Backend-aligned payload types: `types.ts`, `types/`

## CHILD DOCS

- `api/AGENTS.md`: `core.ts`, `authSettings.ts`, `management.ts`, and `observability.ts` ownership beneath the public `api.ts` barrel.
- `websocket/AGENTS.md`: message helpers, subscription bookkeeping, and transport/reconnect rules beneath `websocket.ts`.

## CONVENTIONS

- Pages and hooks should import from `api.ts` or the exported helpers, not call `fetch()` directly.
- `setApiProfileId()` is fed by `ProfileContext`, and `api/core.ts` is the only place that injects `X-Profile-Id` into `/api/*` requests.
- `request()` handles cookie credentials, `ApiError`, and one refresh retry for eligible `/api/*` paths.
- Let `api/AGENTS.md` own the typed client split instead of expanding this parent with module-by-module endpoint detail.
- `referenceData.ts` and `referenceDataRegistry.ts` own shared cache reuse, request dedupe, and revision-keyed invalidation for lookup datasets.
- `configImportValidation.ts` owns frontend-side validation of the current import payload shape, including adaptive `routing_policy` strategy data and vendor `icon_key` presence, instead of leaving that logic in page components.
- `loadbalanceRoutingPolicy.ts` owns the frontend-side default adaptive routing-policy shape and normalized failure-status handling used by settings and model flows.
- `appVersion.ts` owns the browser-facing frontend version contract so shell chrome reads the synced `frontend/package.json` version through Vite instead of hard-coded literals.
- `websocket.ts` owns the singleton client, while `websocket/AGENTS.md` owns protocol parsing, subscription bookkeeping, and reconnect transport helpers. Consumers should use `useRealtimeData()` instead of creating clients directly.
- `timezone.ts` owns shared timezone preference caching and helper access beneath `useTimezone()`.
- `costing.ts` owns shared cost/currency helper logic instead of leaving numeric presentation branches in pages.
- Keep browser WebAuthn ceremony code in `webauthn.ts`.
- Keep backend payload naming aligned with server schemas, including `vendor_id`, `vendor_key`, fixed `api_family` fields, vendor `icon_key` on vendor payloads only, and stats snapshot identifiers like `ingress_request_id`.
- When doing upgrade work, backward compatibility with the pre-upgrade implementation is not a goal unless explicitly requested. Prefer the best current implementation shape over preserving the old one. Do not add compatibility shims, dual paths, or fallback behavior solely to preserve the old interface.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not bypass `api/core.ts` for Prism backend requests or inject `X-Profile-Id` from pages.
- Do not create ad hoc websocket clients or duplicate subscribe/unsubscribe bookkeeping outside `websocket.ts` and `websocket/`.
- Do not add a parallel reference-data cache when `referenceData.ts` already owns the shared lookup datasets.
- Do not duplicate config import validation in page or dialog code when `configImportValidation.ts` already mirrors that contract.
- Do not move passkey browser ceremony into page components when `webauthn.ts` already owns it.
- Do not duplicate timezone or cost helper logic in page folders when `timezone.ts` and `costing.ts` already own those seams.
- Do not camelCase backend response fields in the shared type layer.
