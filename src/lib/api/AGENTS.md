# FRONTEND API CLIENT KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`lib/api/` is the typed `/api/*` client split behind `../api.ts`. It owns shared request plumbing in `core.ts`, then groups endpoints by auth/settings, management CRUD, and observability/config/audit/loadbalance surfaces.

## STRUCTURE
```
api/
├── core.ts           # API base, credentials, X-Profile-Id injection, refresh retry, query builder
├── authSettings.ts   # Auth bootstrap/session/login/logout, settings.auth, proxy keys, WebAuthn
├── management.ts     # Profiles, vendors, models, loadbalance strategies, endpoints, connections, pricing templates
└── observability.ts  # Stats, usage snapshot, config import/export, audit, loadbalance events/current-state, settings costing/timezone
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Public import surface over these modules: `../api.ts`
- Shared request rules, cookie credentials, `ApiError`, auth-refresh retry, and `X-Profile-Id` injection for `/api/*`: `core.ts`
- Cookie-auth bootstrap/session flows, settings auth endpoints, proxy-key endpoints, and browser WebAuthn endpoints: `authSettings.ts`
- Profile-scoped management CRUD surfaces for profiles, vendors, models, loadbalance strategies, endpoints, connections, and pricing templates: `management.ts`
- Observability, usage snapshot, throughput, config import/export, audit, loadbalance current state/events, and settings costing/timezone clients: `observability.ts`

## CONVENTIONS

- Keep `core.ts` as the only place that injects `X-Profile-Id`, applies cookie credentials, and performs one refresh retry for eligible `/api/*` requests.
- Keep grouped endpoint surfaces in their existing modules instead of expanding `api.ts` into a second implementation layer.
- Keep auth/settings nesting in `authSettings.ts` and `api.settings` aligned with the backend route structure.
- Keep observability-side query building centralized through `buildQuery()` and typed param objects.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not call `fetch()` directly for Prism backend requests when this client layer already owns credentials and error handling.
- Do not inject `X-Profile-Id` from pages, hooks, or provider code outside `core.ts`.
- Do not split one endpoint family across multiple client modules without a real backend-boundary change.
