# FRONTEND SETTINGS COSTING KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/settings/costing/` owns the settings-side costing hooks that support billing, currency, FX mapping, and timezone behavior. This folder handles bootstrap, normalized derived state, FX mapping CRUD state, and save flows, while `../sections/billing-currency/` stays focused on rendering the billing and currency UI.

## STRUCTURE
```
costing/
├── useCostingSettingsBootstrap.ts   # Load costing settings and shared model options
├── useCostingDerivedState.ts        # Dirty flags, preview text, labels, and mapping options
├── useCostingMappingCrud.ts         # FX mapping create, edit, delete, and connection loading
└── useCostingSettingsSave.ts        # Billing save and timezone save flows
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Bootstrap fetches for costing settings and shared models: `useCostingSettingsBootstrap.ts`
- Normalization, dirty-state derivation, timezone preview, model labels, and endpoint options: `useCostingDerivedState.ts`
- FX mapping CRUD, selected-model connection loading, and inline validation: `useCostingMappingCrud.ts`
- Billing save and timezone save boundaries: `useCostingSettingsSave.ts`
- Shared defaults, normalization helpers, mapping validation, and formatting helpers: `../settingsPageHelpers.ts`
- Billing and currency rendering layer: `../sections/BillingCurrencySection.tsx`, `../sections/billing-currency/`

## BOUNDARY

- `costing/` owns stateful hooks, normalization, validation, and save orchestration.
- `sections/BillingCurrencySection.tsx` owns the section shell that wires those hooks into the settings page.
- `sections/billing-currency/` owns presentation widgets such as the reporting currency card, FX mapping form, summary, and table.
- Timezone saving stays in this hook cluster because it shares the costing-form baseline and dirty-state model, even though the rendered section lives in `../sections/TimezoneSection.tsx`.

## CONVENTIONS

- Keep costing data normalized through `normalizeCostingForm()` before dirty checks or saves.
- Preserve the split between billing saves and timezone saves. Timezone save depends on a valid saved billing baseline.
- Load FX mapping endpoint choices from the selected model's connections inside the CRUD hook, not inside presentation components.
- Reuse `settingsPageHelpers.ts` for mapping keys, validation, formatting, and default state.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not move FX mapping CRUD state into `sections/billing-currency/` UI components.
- Do not collapse billing and timezone saves into one generic action when the hook boundary keeps their validation rules clear.
- Do not duplicate normalization or mapping validation logic outside this hook cluster and `settingsPageHelpers.ts`.
