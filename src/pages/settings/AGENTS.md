# FRONTEND SETTINGS DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/settings/` is the route-domain shell behind `../SettingsPage.tsx`. It owns the Profile and Global tab split, stable section and tab helpers, hash-driven section focus, shared save-state rendering, and the dialog handoff that supports settings mutations. Keep shell behavior here, section rendering in `sections/AGENTS.md`, and costing state in `costing/AGENTS.md`.

## SHELL CONTRACT

- `SettingsPage.tsx` renders two tabs: `Profile` and `Global`.
- The Profile tab owns section navigation and mounts backup, billing and currency, timezone, audit and privacy, and retention and deletion.
- The Global tab mounts instance-wide authentication plus the shared vendor-management section and its dialogs. Vendor rows carry the persisted optional `icon_key`, while model rows do not.
- `settingsPageHelpers.ts` is the source of truth for tab ids, profile section ids, instance-only section handling, delete keywords, and shared costing and auth validation helpers.

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Thin route shell, tab split, section order, and dialog mounts: `../SettingsPage.tsx`
- Cross-section composition, selected-profile labeling, and shared save-state handoff: `useSettingsPageData.ts`
- Active tab state, hash updates, scroll-driven focus, and section jump behavior: `useSettingsPageSectionState.ts`, `SettingsSectionsNav.tsx`, with section-nav helpers still living nearby when they support the shell contract
- Stable helper constants and form-normalization utilities: `settingsPageHelpers.ts`
- Shared save-state badges and render helpers: `sectionSaveState.tsx`, `settingsSaveTypes.ts`
- Section implementation boundary: `sections/AGENTS.md`
- Costing bootstrap, derived state, FX mapping CRUD, and save boundary: `costing/AGENTS.md`
- Global vendor CRUD, usage prefetch, shared-cache patching, and delete-conflict parsing: `useVendorManagementData.ts`, `vendorManagementFormState.ts`
- Local dialogs for destructive actions and audit rule editing: `dialogs/`, `useAuditConfigurationData.ts`, `useRetentionDeletionData.ts`, `useConfigBackupData.ts`, `dialogs/VendorDialog.tsx`, `dialogs/DeleteVendorDialog.tsx`

## CHILD DOCS

- `sections/AGENTS.md`: authentication-adjacent section UI, audit and privacy, billing and currency, backup, retention, timezone, and the nested `authentication/` and `billing-currency/` clusters.
- `sections/authentication/AGENTS.md`: operator account, recovery email verification, passkey ceremony, and passkey presentation metadata.
- `costing/AGENTS.md`: costing bootstrap, dirty-state derivation, FX mapping CRUD, save flows, and the split between costing hooks and billing-currency section UI.

## CONVENTIONS

- Keep new settings work sectionized. Extend helper registries, shared hooks, or local dialogs instead of inflating `SettingsPage.tsx`.
- Hash navigation is part of the settings UX contract. New profile-tab sections need stable ids and must participate in jump and active-section logic.
- Save-state feedback belongs in `sectionSaveState.tsx` and related helper types, not in ad hoc spinners or toast-only status.
- Keep the scope split clear in copy and behavior: authentication is global, while backup, billing and currency, timezone, audit and privacy, and retention stay profile-scoped.
- Keep shared vendor catalog CRUD on the Global tab and continue to let the Profile-tab audit defaults consume that same shared vendor catalog.
- Keep vendor icon metadata on the shared vendor catalog and preserve it through global CRUD flows.
- `SettingsProfileTab.tsx` and `SettingsGlobalTab.tsx` own the tab bodies, while the shell hook keeps their section state synchronized.
- Billing, reporting currency, timezone preference, and FX mappings cross the `sections/` and `costing/` boundary. Let this parent doc describe the split, then send readers down instead of repeating local details.
- Keep dialogs local to `pages/settings/dialogs/` when they support audit-rule edits or destructive confirmation flows.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not add inline modal branches to `SettingsPage.tsx` when a local dialog file already fits the flow.
- Do not bypass shared save-state helpers with one-off loading badges or toast-only feedback.
- Do not duplicate auth, FX mapping, or billing-currency implementation detail here when the child docs already own it.
