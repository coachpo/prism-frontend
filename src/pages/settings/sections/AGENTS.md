# FRONTEND SETTINGS SECTIONS KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/settings/sections/` owns the rendered settings sections used by `../SettingsPage.tsx`. This folder covers the section-level UI for auth setup, shared vendor management, audit and privacy, billing and currency, backup, retention and deletion, and timezone preferences, plus the nested `authentication/` and `billing-currency/` UI clusters. Keep it focused on section rendering, not the shell or costing orchestration.

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Auth setup, verified-email prerequisites, and passkey UX: `AuthenticationSection.tsx`, `authentication/`
- Shared vendor-catalog table and Global-tab entrypoints for create/edit/delete flows: `VendorManagementSection.tsx`
- Audit and privacy defaults, header blocklist, vendor toggles, and rules-panel rendering remain vendor-based in this plan, even though request logs and statistics now filter by `api_family`: `AuditConfigurationSection.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationDefaultsCard.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationHeaderBlocklistCard.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationVendorToggles.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationRulesPanel.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationRuleActions.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationRuleSection.tsx`, `AuditConfigurationRuleTable.tsx`
- Billing and currency section shell that renders reporting currency and FX mapping UI, while staying separate from costing state: `BillingCurrencySection.tsx`, `billing-currency/`
- Backup and config import or export section: `BackupSection.tsx`
- Retention and deletion section: `RetentionDeletionSection.tsx`
- Timezone preference section: `TimezoneSection.tsx`
- Shared page shell, section IDs, and save-state helpers: `../AGENTS.md`, `../settingsPageHelpers.ts`, `../sectionSaveState.tsx`
- Costing bootstrap, derived state, and save logic that feeds billing and timezone sections: `../costing/AGENTS.md`

## LOCAL CLUSTERS

- `authentication/`: auth status cards, setup field shells, passkey metadata, `usePasskeyManagement.ts`, and the nested `authentication/AGENTS.md` leaf
- `billing-currency/`: `ReportingCurrencyCard.tsx`, `FxMappingForm.tsx`, `FxMappingsSummary.tsx`, and `FxMappingsTable.tsx`

## CONVENTIONS

- Keep these files focused on section rendering, local field composition, and section-specific copy.
- Let `authentication/` own browser passkey ceremony and credential presentation details.
- Let `VendorManagementSection.tsx` stay rendering-focused; bootstrap, cache patching, and delete-conflict logic belong to the parent settings hooks and dialogs.
- Let `VendorManagementSection.tsx` stay rendering-focused and show vendor icon metadata from the shared catalog, with fallback monogram or placeholder rendering handled by the shared icon component layer.
- Let `billing-currency/` own the reporting-currency card and FX mapping presentation widgets.
- Pull bootstrap, dirty-state derivation, and save orchestration from the parent settings hooks instead of rebuilding that logic inside section components.
- Keep section IDs and save-state wiring aligned with the parent settings helpers.
- Let `BillingCurrencySection.tsx` stay a rendering boundary. The hooks that own costing changes live in `../costing/`.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not move auth setup or passkey browser logic out of `authentication/`.
- Do not move FX mapping CRUD state into `billing-currency/` presentation components. That boundary belongs to `../costing/`.
- Do not invent extra settings sections or nested AGENTS files beyond the local clusters already covered here. `authentication/AGENTS.md` is the one justified nested leaf; `billing-currency/` remains parent-covered.
