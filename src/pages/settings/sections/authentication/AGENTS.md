# FRONTEND SETTINGS AUTHENTICATION CLUSTER KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/settings/sections/authentication/` owns the local authentication setup cluster inside the settings section UI. Keep operator account state, recovery email verification, passkey ceremony, and presentation metadata split along the live component boundaries.

## STRUCTURE
```
authentication/
├── AuthenticationStatusCard.tsx
├── AuthenticationSetupGrid.tsx
├── AuthenticationFieldShell.tsx
├── OperatorEmailCard.tsx
├── RecoveryEmailCard.tsx
├── PasskeysCard.tsx
├── passkeyMetadata.ts
├── usePasskeyManagement.ts
├── types.ts
└── __tests__/                # Local auth-section coverage
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Authentication status and setup composition: `AuthenticationStatusCard.tsx`, `AuthenticationSetupGrid.tsx`
- Shared field framing for operator-account and recovery-email inputs: `AuthenticationFieldShell.tsx`
- Operator account username, password, and save controls: `OperatorEmailCard.tsx`
- Recovery email verification and resend flow: `RecoveryEmailCard.tsx`
- Passkey ceremony, list, register, and remove orchestration: `PasskeysCard.tsx`, `usePasskeyManagement.ts`
- Presentation metadata and small shared types: `passkeyMetadata.ts`, `types.ts`
- Local auth-section tests: `__tests__/`

## CONVENTIONS

- Keep operator account, recovery email, and passkey flows separate in copy and behavior.
- Keep `AuthenticationFieldShell.tsx` as the shared field wrapper for operator-account and recovery-email cards.
- Let `usePasskeyManagement.ts` own the ceremony and mutation orchestration, while `PasskeysCard.tsx` owns the UI and dialogs.
- Keep `passkeyMetadata.ts` limited to display metadata and labels.
- When doing upgrade work, backward compatibility with the pre-upgrade implementation is not a goal unless explicitly requested. Do not add compatibility shims, dual paths, or fallback behavior solely to preserve the old interface.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not move passkey ceremony orchestration into the card UI.
- Do not duplicate presentation metadata in multiple auth components.
- Do not introduce costing concerns or shell-state ownership here.
