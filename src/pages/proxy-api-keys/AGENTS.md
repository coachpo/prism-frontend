# FRONTEND PROXY API KEYS DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/proxy-api-keys/` owns global proxy-key issuance, edit, rotation, deletion, auth-status messaging, and one-time secret display behind `../ProxyApiKeysPage.tsx`. These are instance credentials, so the page stays global rather than selected-profile scoped.

## STRUCTURE
```
proxy-api-keys/
├── ProxyKeyCreateCard.tsx        # Create form and latest-generated-key display
├── ProxyKeysListCard.tsx         # Existing key list with actions
├── ProxyKeyCard.tsx              # Individual key row/card presentation
├── ProxyKeyStatusCallout.tsx     # Auth-enabled guidance and warnings
├── EditProxyKeyDialog.tsx        # Edit name, note, and active-state flow
├── DeleteProxyKeyDialog.tsx      # Delete confirmation flow
├── ProxyApiKeysPageSkeleton.tsx  # Loading state
├── proxyKeyFormatting.ts         # Auth-status tone helpers
└── useProxyApiKeysPageData.ts    # Parallel bootstrap, create, edit, rotate, delete, and badge state
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Parallel bootstrap of auth settings and current keys: `useProxyApiKeysPageData.ts`
- Create and rotate flows with one-time secret handling: `useProxyApiKeysPageData.ts`, `ProxyKeyCreateCard.tsx`
- Edit dialog flow for stored metadata and active state: `EditProxyKeyDialog.tsx`, `ProxyKeysListCard.tsx`, `useProxyApiKeysPageData.ts`
- Delete confirmations and list patching: `DeleteProxyKeyDialog.tsx`, `useProxyApiKeysPageData.ts`
- Auth-status badge tone and callout copy: `proxyKeyFormatting.ts`, `ProxyKeyStatusCallout.tsx`

## CONVENTIONS

- Treat proxy API key management as a global auth-settings workflow, not a selected-profile feature.
- Bootstrap auth settings and existing keys in parallel with `Promise.allSettled()`.
- Patch the local key list after create, edit, rotate, and delete flows instead of reloading the whole page.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not scope proxy-key UX to the selected profile; runtime keys are global instance credentials.
- Do not discard the latest generated secret before the user has a chance to copy it.
- Do not reload the page after create, edit, rotate, or delete when `useProxyApiKeysPageData.ts` already patches state locally.
