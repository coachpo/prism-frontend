# FRONTEND STATISTICS DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/statistics/` owns the unified `/statistics` route behind `../StatisticsPage.tsx`. The live page is snapshot-driven, not tab-driven, and it is coordinated by `useUsageStatisticsPageState.ts` for local persisted presentation state plus `useUsageStatisticsPageData.ts` for snapshot orchestration. Keep this route focused on aggregate snapshot views split across `charts/`, `sections/`, and `tables/`.

## STRUCTURE
```
statistics/
├── charts/                         # Usage-snapshot charts and local chart helpers
├── sections/                       # Page sections and snapshot summaries
├── tables/                         # Aggregate endpoint, model, and proxy-api-key tables
├── UsageStatisticsPageSkeleton.tsx # Page-level loading shell for the unified route
├── StatisticsPageSkeleton.tsx      # Secondary skeleton kept for local fallback/test coverage
├── useUsageStatisticsPageData.ts   # Snapshot loading and page-data orchestration
├── useUsageStatisticsPageState.ts  # Local persisted presentation state
├── usageStatisticsStorage.ts       # localStorage persistence helpers
└── __tests__/                      # State, data, refresh, and table coverage
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Thin route shell and top-level section orchestration: `../StatisticsPage.tsx`
- Route-shell copy and presentation labels: `../StatisticsPage.tsx`, `@/i18n/useLocale`, `@/i18n/AGENTS.md`
- Snapshot orchestration and persisted presentation state: `useUsageStatisticsPageData.ts`, `useUsageStatisticsPageState.ts`, `usageStatisticsStorage.ts`
- Usage-snapshot charts, sections, and tables: `charts/`, `sections/`, `tables/`
- Aggregate endpoint, model, and proxy-api-key tables: `tables/`
- Unified route loading shell: `UsageStatisticsPageSkeleton.tsx`
- Shared statistics cards and chart wrappers: `../../components/AGENTS.md`
- Shared presentation helpers and timezone-aware formatting inputs: `@/hooks/useTimezone`, `@/components/ui/chart.tsx`

## CONVENTIONS

- Treat local persisted presentation state as the source of truth for page preferences that should survive reloads. The current unified statistics page does not expose a dedicated route-level query-param contract.
- Keep unified usage-snapshot orchestration in `useUsageStatisticsPageData.ts`, not in section or table components.
- Keep this route aggregate-focused. Request-log investigation belongs on `/request-logs`, not inside the statistics tables.
- Keep route-shell and section copy on the shared locale boundary through `useLocale()`, and keep locale-aware formatting on the shared helpers rather than page-local string logic.
- The dense `charts/`, `sections/`, and `tables/` subfolders stay parent-covered. Do not add extra AGENTS files for them.
- Keep null-vs-zero rendering differences visible in helpers and copy, so missing data stays distinct from a true zero value.
- When doing upgrade work, backward compatibility with the pre-upgrade implementation is not a goal unless explicitly requested. Do not add compatibility shims, dual paths, or fallback behavior solely to preserve the old interface.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not recreate the tab/query-param model inside section or table components.
- Do not regress null-vs-zero rendering for usage or cost metrics. Statistics depends on that distinction for triage.
- Do not create standalone AGENTS files for `charts/`, `sections/`, or `tables/`. This parent doc owns those local clusters.
