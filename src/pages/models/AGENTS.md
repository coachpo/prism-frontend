# FRONTEND MODELS DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW
`pages/models/` owns the models list search and row-card presentation, dialog state, vendor and `api_family` form logic, ordered proxy-target editing for proxy models, native strategy attachment during create or edit, and separate 24-hour metric hydration behind `../ModelsPage.tsx`.

## STRUCTURE
```
models/
├── ModelDialog.tsx         # Create-edit dialog
├── DeleteModelDialog.tsx   # Delete confirmation flow
├── modelFormState.ts       # Form defaults, payload transforms, native-target helpers
├── ModelsTable.tsx         # Search-filtered horizontal row list + row actions
├── ModelsToolbar.tsx       # Search-only toolbar
├── modelTableContracts.ts  # Shared metric type contract
├── useModelMetrics24h.ts   # 24h metrics and spend hydration
└── useModelsPageData.ts    # Shared-cache bootstrap, local patching, dialog orchestration
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

- Shared model/vendor bootstrap and mutation patching: `useModelsPageData.ts`
- Proxy/native form behavior, strategy attachment rules, ordered proxy-target normalization, vendor selection, and payload transforms that carry `vendor_id` plus fixed `api_family`: `modelFormState.ts`
- 24h metrics and spend overlays: `useModelMetrics24h.ts`
- Search toolbar: `ModelsToolbar.tsx`
- Row rendering, navigation, and row actions: `ModelsTable.tsx`

## CONVENTIONS

- Bootstrap models and vendors from `@/lib/referenceData`, then patch the local list with `setSharedModels()` after mutations.
- Keep proxy/native validation, strategy attachment rules, vendor selection, and `api_family` handling in `modelFormState.ts` instead of scattering them across dialog components.
- Keep ordered proxy-target add/remove/reorder state in `modelFormState.ts`; `ModelDialog.tsx` should stay a thin rendering layer over that logic.
- Hydrate 24h metrics separately from the base model list so CRUD flows do not own observability queries.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not rebuild proxy/native strategy or form rules outside `modelFormState.ts`.
- Do not let table components own API calls; `useModelsPageData.ts` already centralizes list mutations.
- Do not fold metrics queries into the base list bootstrap when `useModelMetrics24h.ts` already isolates that concern.
